        <br>
        <p>
            My name is Arjun Dhiman, and I am studying in Class 12. My school name is Public Inter College, Sadholi Kadeem. I live in Village Jatowala, Tehsil Behat, District Saharanpur. I study in Hindi medium. My subjects include Hindi, English, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry.<br>
            There are 4 members in my family: my brother and my parents. My father works in labour. My mother is a homemaker.<br>

            When my class teacher introduced me to coding, I instantly got hooked. It was fascinating to see how computer applications work as a blend of software and hardware. This experience not only sparked my curiosity but also fueled my passion to dive deeper into the world of coding.<br>

            In May, our class teacher introduced me about CodeYogi, an initiative aimed at helping students from rural areas learn coding.<br>

            Through CodeYogi, I have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and React. At home, I practice coding on both my mobile phone and PC. So far, I have completed 50 levels of the Telegram course and 3 lectures from the advanced playlist.<br>

            My Dream:<br>
            I aspire to become a Software Engineer and work in software and web development. who provides innovative solutions to real-world problems. I aspire to build my own company that tackles job-related challenges and reduces unemployment by connecting people with opportunities. I want to contribute to the IT sector by creating systems and applications that make life easier for everyone.<br>

            My Inspiration:<br>
            I believe hard work and a willingness to learn can help anyone achieve their goals. Coming from a humble background, I take pride in my journey so far and look forward to making a mark in the tech world. I aim to not only build my career but also inspire others who, like me, dare to dream big and work hard to achieve their aspirations.
